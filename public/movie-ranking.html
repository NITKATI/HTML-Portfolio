<h1>The Best Movies According to Nitin</h1>
<h2>My Top 5 Movies of all time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>1. Fight Club</h3>
<p>
This movie have one of best script, acting and screenplay.Fight Club is promoting the philosophy of many spiritual leaders,<br /> 
that we are not our possessions, that we are more than what we own. This ties back to second lesson, that the pain and <br />
sacrifice we must make will most likely involve our possessions. </p>
<h3>2. Shutter Island</h3>
<p>He pays attention to every detail in this film, making "Shutter Island" one of the best suspense thrillers of all time.<br />
Visually intriguing, simplistic and absolutely phenomenal. The story is kept simplistic enough so it doesn't get absurd,<br />
but allows for an ending which you probably won't see coming.</p>
<h3>3. Gang of Wasseypur</h3>
<p> Its dark humor, experimental soundtrack, and its raw and realistic filmmaking style not done by any Bollywood film before.</p>
<h3>4. 3 Idiots</h3>
<p>"3 Idiots" uses its unique comedic art to point out social problems and reflect critical thinking from the outside to the inside.<br /> 
At the same time, it repeatedly uses story conflicts to strengthen the expression of the film's core ideas.</p>
<h3>5. Taare Zameen Par</h3>
<p>This movie teaches a lesson to the guardians, peers as well as teachers how to behave their child or student, behaving abnormal<br /> 
or very different from the behavior of common children.</p>
